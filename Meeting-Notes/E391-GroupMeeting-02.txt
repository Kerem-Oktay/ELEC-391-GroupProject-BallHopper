SUBJECT: High Level System Description and Inital Ideas for the Mechanism
DATE: February 23, 2023
PLACE: Kaiser
TIME: 5.00PM-7.00PM
-------------------------------
NOTES:

High Level System

	Operation
		Go down
		See the object
		Close the fingers
		Keep them closed until reached destination
		See the destination
		Open the fingers

	Features Needed
		Manual reset
		Digital LED I/O
		Mech interface plate
		Power ratings

	Sensors
		Ultrasonic Sensors: See the object
		Strain Gage: Finger force
		Inductive Sensor: See the destination

	Objects to pick up
		Tennis balls
			easy to get around with
			not many different "object types"
		Cups/Bottles/Cans
			can go different types and orientations of objects
	
	Extra features
		UI to manually control the gripper
		LCD Screen to display the state

Concept

	Ideas
		3 fingers with unbalanced orientation
		gears and two fingers
		1 finger stable, 1 finger scooping
		finer grabing methods with more motors

	Chosen
		3 fingers with unbalanced orientation
		finer grabing methods with more motors


-------------------------------
ACTION ITEMS:

Jaydon -> finish mech models by March 3
Kerem/Idil -> finish circuit (both analog and digital) by March 6
Phi -> get started with programming workflow, PID Gains decided by March 6

Next Meeting March 3
	finish up mech and choose motor during the meeting
