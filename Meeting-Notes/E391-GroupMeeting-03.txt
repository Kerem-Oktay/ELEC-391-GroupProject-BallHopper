SUBJECT: Controller Discussions and Preliminary PLD Design 
DATE: March 3, 2023
PLACE: MCLD
TIME: 5.30PM-7.00PM
-------------------------------
NOTES:

Updates
	Preliminary mechanism design is complete
	Looking for parts to build the prototype
		bearings, gears, actuators and etc.
	
Controller design
	multivariable??
		finger force
		position
	must relate the "ticks" of the encoder into degrees of motor and then into linear movement
	encoder of a given motor only has 12 ticks so must design gears to get "big" rotations into "small" linear movement
	mainly build around the position
	desired input can be either
		fully closed fingers
			not really design??
			just makes the motor go all the way
		partially closed fingers
			more design
			must decide a value first
			can be any value for the design phase??
			can it be changed by the mcu during the operation? or does it have to be preset?
	decided to go with partially closed fingers approach

PLD design
	counter to count the up/down movement of encoder pulses
	counter will be the clock of the seq. cct. and each pulse value will be increased/decreased
	latch/flip-flop cct. for memory
		hold the value of the counter cct. and feed to mcu when requested
	approaches
		simple latches with clear signal from mcu
			will know ticks between ISRs
		simple latches with no clear?
			not sure, latches might need a clear in some way
		flip-flop	
			more robust?
			clk signal from mcu triggered with a separate ISR
			might have to be careful with timing as there should be some time given to pld to update output 
	more info is needed

-------------------------------
ACTION ITEMS:

March 6 -> cct design complete, matlab model progress

Decide and write down RCGs (high-level and sub-system)
	reach out to TAs to clarify 5 RCG statement
