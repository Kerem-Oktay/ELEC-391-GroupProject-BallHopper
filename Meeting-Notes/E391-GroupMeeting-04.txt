            - R: Board must be 8cm x 3cm 
            - C: Board size must fit into 10cm x 5cm area
            - G: Minimize board size as much as possible
        - Trace line 
            - R: Trace width large enough to support 5A current
            - C: Trace width has to allow us to fit all the components on the board
            - G: Minimize trace width
        - Motor driver power consumption
            - R: Motor current trace has to be 0.5 inches away from encoder feedback trace
            - C: It can't be closer than x inches 
            - G: As close as possible to minmize board area
